# Please note that the server is crashing sometimes but no worries, all is handeled 

- Json placeholder is crashing but I add error catching so that a message will appear if the request fails


## Styles

- I added some spinners, skeleton and loaders To enhance the user experience.
- You will also find a styled scrollbar for the posts content If the length of the body was huge.

## Dependecies
- This project uses Vue3, Vue-router, Bootstrap 5, FontAwesome 6, Toastr.js and Axios for handling requests
